## Introduction

The Winter Rescue is a Minecraft-based mod integration pack, with core gameplay elements including realistic survival, technological construction, exploration and adventure, and town management. In the game, the mid-21st century cold wave event plunged the Earth into a prolonged winter, and the remaining human joint government established the last safe haven on a space station. As the player, you play the role of an explorer from the space station, who decides to return to Earth after receiving a mysterious message seemingly from long-lost blood relatives. You will find your footing in the harsh winter, explore the remaining major forces, and gradually uncover the secret of the world's loss of vitality during your journey.

In a harsh, beautiful, mysterious, and realistic winter world, adapting to the changing climate and maintaining body temperature is your primary survival task. Once you find your footing, you will start from scratch, regaining knowledge through exploration and research, and using your hands to build an industrial base centered around steam thermal energy. When everything is ready, you can invite exiled refugees to join you in building a self-sufficient town. Meanwhile, you will advance the main storyline, navigating the remaining forces in the harsh winter, adventuring to the deepest parts of the world to restore vitality and uncover the truth.

The core mechanism of The Winter Rescue is temperature: this includes natural temperatures, i.e., the cold climate, and the human response to it, i.e., heat. For player survival, the mechanism is reflected in the realistic simulation of body temperature; for technological construction, it is reflected in the production and utilization of high-temperature steam thermal energy; for exploration and adventure, it is reflected in surviving organisms in low temperatures, various shelters built for warmth, and heat-based weapon systems; and town management is self-explanatory – players must ensure the warmth and food supply of each resident and provide suitable temperatures and thermal energy for town buildings.
